My project is a small begginer project in java in which my code takes a random integer number less than 100 and takes the input from user to guess the same number until a user enters a number greater than zero if user
enters the 0 or negative number then the execution of while loop get stopped and prints that random number.If user enters the number less than that number code tells to enter the bigger number and if it is smaller then 
code tells to enter a bigger number.if the number entered is same as the random number it tell "You guessed it right" and exit the loop using break statement.
